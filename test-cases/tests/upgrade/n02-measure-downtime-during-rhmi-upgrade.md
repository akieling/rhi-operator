# N02 - Measure downtime during RHMI upgrade

## Prerequisites

1. Login via `oc` as a user with **cluster-admin** role (kubeadmin):

```
oc login --token=<TOKEN> --server=https://api.<CLUSTER_NAME>.s1.devshift.org:6443
```

2. Node.js installed locally

3. [ocm CLI](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli/releases) installed locally

4. [jq v1.6](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases) installed locally

## Steps

1. Clone delorean repo with `measure-downtime` script:

   > git clone https://github.com/integr8ly/delorean
   > cd delorean/scripts/ocm

2. Run script before you trigger upgrade:

   > node measure-downtime.js

3. Trigger upgrade of RHMI on cluster

4. Login to the ocm staging environment and get the ID of the cluster that is going to be upgraded:

```bash
# Get the token at https://qaprodauth.cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token
ocm login --url=https://api.stage.openshift.com --token=<YOUR-TOKEN>
CLUSTER_ID=$(ocm cluster list | grep <CLUSTER-NAME> | awk '{print $1}')
```

5. Poll cluster to check when it is finished upgrading:

```bash
watch -n 60 "ocm get cluster $CLUSTER_ID | jq -r .metrics.upgrade.state | grep -q completed && echo 'Upgrade completed\!'"
```

> This script will run every 60 seconds to check whether the OpenShift upgrade has finished
> Once it's finished, it should print out "Upgrade completed!" (it could take ~1 hour)

6. Go to the OpenShift console, go through the `redhat-rhmi` prefixed namespaces and verify that all routes (Networking -> Routes) of RHMI components are accessible

   > If some of the routes are not accessible, try again later. If they won't come up in the end, report the issue.

7. Terminate the process for measuring the downtime of components in terminal window #1

   > It takes couple of seconds until all results are collected
   > The results will be written down to the file `downtime.json`

8. Upload that file to the JIRA ticket

9. Consult the results with engineering (especially in case some components have a long downtime or are not working properly)
